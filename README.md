<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3306/3306613.png" width="32" height="32"> About The Project
A personal data management software that is prepared in a manner that makes it impervious to any attacks. Essentially, your details after creating an account are stored on a decentralized blockchain that even we cannot access. This data is then further encrypted, and can only be decrypted via a unique key that is provided to you upon registration.

As the world moves forward and more and more concerns regarding 'private' data come up, the need for decentralizing control over stored data becomes a global priority. Thus, this project is our humble contribution towards taking the control of data away from large corporations towards smaller, well-connected communities and individuals.
